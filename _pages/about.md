Hi there! I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher working with 
                          <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/boi.faltings" target="_blank">Boi Faltings</a>, 
                          <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/robert.west" target="_blank">Robert West</a>, and

                                <!--<a href="https://lia.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">LIA lab</a>,  
                                <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">dLab</a>, and 
                                <a href="https://nlp.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">NLP</a> --> at
                          <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">EPFL</a>. Before EPFL, I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of 
                          <a href="http://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/~frank/" target="_blank"> Anette Frank </a> in the Department of Computational Linguistics at Heidelberg University and also a part of <a href="https://www.aiphes.tu-darmstadt.de/de/aiphes/" target="_blank">Research Training Group AIPHES</a>. <br />

<!--The core of my research lies at the convergence of Linguistics, Cognitive Science, and AI. Currently, my research focuses on (controllable) text generation, commonsense reasoning, and unsupervised learning.

The research topics that I focus on are as follows: <br />

<ul>
  <li><b> Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning </b>: I'm interested in improving the ability of existing AI systems to think logically by developing techniques for integrating structured knowledge into AI systems.  <br /></li>
  <li><b> Interactive methods </b>: I'm interested in building interactive methods that make human interaction with AI more intuitive. <br /></li>
  <li><b> Commonsense Reasoning </b>: I'm interested in constructing data and models that leverage commonsense knowledge derived from language and graphical representations to facilitate commonsense reasoning and its practical applications. <br /></li>
</ul> 

Finally, my long-term research objective is to imbue machines with human-like communication abilities and commonsense knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Build AI systems that can do complex interplay between language, knowledge representation, and cognitive reasoning processes.-->

My overarching research objective is to enhance the <b>reasoning capabilities of NLP systems</b> by advancing their ability to understand the complex interplay between language, knowledge representation, and cognitive reasoning processes. To accomplish this goal, I have focused my investigations in three areas:

<ul>
<li><b>Reasoning with knowledge representations</b> - NLP systems must be grounded by knowledge dynamics to generalize to unseen situations robustly. My research has focused on designing computational models capable of reasoning over knowledge. <br /></li>
<li><b>Learning to generate explanations for reasoning</b> - When a model explains its decision-making steps or logical steps it took to reach that conclusion, it enhances transparency and helps build trust in the system. My research has focused on designing computational models that generate explanations before making the final decisions.<br /></li>
<li><b>Aligning Models with Human or AI Feedback</b> - Text generation models are observed to display undesired and inconsistent behaviours, such as hallucination and unfaithful reasoning. My research has focused on designing methods to rectify the undesired behaviours of text generation models through interaction.<br /></li>
</ul>
